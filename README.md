# java_lern

Personal Java learning repository with small, focused samples for blog notes.

## Structure
- Each category is a top-level folder (e.g., network, jdbc).
- Each topic is a subfolder with its own README and src.

## Categories
- network
- jdbc

## How to add a new topic
1. Create a folder under a category, e.g. network/http.
2. Add README.md with purpose and run steps.
3. Add source files in src/.

## Conventions
- Keep each topic self-contained.
- Use small, incremental commits per topic.
